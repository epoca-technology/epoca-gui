/**
 * State Type
 * All market state modules can be stateful or stateless and are update constantly.
 * There are 2 kinds of modules within the Market State. There are those that rely
 * on a sequence of values and the state is calculated based on the percentage change
 * between the beginning and the end of the window. On the other hand, there are
 * other modules which don't rely on a sequence but instead the result of a series
 * of calculations.
 * 
 * Sequence Based Modules:
 * A stateless type (0) is active when the change between the beginning and
 * the end of the window (or any sequence) doesn't meet the requirement.
 * An increasing state (2|1) is issued when the window as increased the required
 * % and that the latest value is within the upper band. On the other hand,
 * for a decreasing state (-2|-1) to be issued, the window must have decreased the
 * required % and the latest value must be within the lower band.
 * 
 * Technical Analysis Module:
 * A neutral type (0) is active when the indicators are not explicitly pointing 
 * towards a direction. The buy type is represented with a 1 while the strong buy 
 * is represented with a 2. In contrast, sell is represented with a -1 and strong
 * sell with a -2.
