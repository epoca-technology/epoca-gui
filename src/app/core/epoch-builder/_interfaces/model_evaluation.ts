  * Model Evaluation
  * Evaluation performed right after the model is trained in order to get an overview of the
  * potential accuracy, as well as the prediction type distribution.
  * The evaluation works similarly to the backtests and it is only performed on the test
  * dataset to ensure the model has not yet seen it.
